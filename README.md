# driving_simulator
Physics engine for driving simulation (open-source project) 

This project is about a driving simulator that uses the library Allegro.h for the output view.
Unfortunately, the simulator can be used in Linux only (POSIX threads used).
These are the steps required to run this project:

1) Install the library Allegro. h by executing the following command in Linux:
   sudo apt-get install liballegro-dev
2) Download the project and unzip it in a directory
3) cd to the root directory of this project and execute the command
   make
You should now be able to see the executable ready to be run.
